## Aims: intro to datascript

 + What is datascript?
 + What's the use case?
 + Simple queries
 + Using queries to build an app renderer


## Practicality

App with simple database. Build the renderers with datascript requests

Views use datascript to present the same db data eg:

  - messages per rooms
  - rooms with unread messages
  - messages by unread status
  - room by messages
  - etc...
